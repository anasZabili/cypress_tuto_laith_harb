Install Cypress:
  npm install Cypress

Run Cypress:
  npx cypress open

Select the right page to test:
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.visit("/element");
  });
  here before each test we set the current tested page
  at /element (the root of this url is the based root set
  in the cypress.json)


Select element :
  GET:
    Get by Tag:
      cy.get("button"), get all the button of the page
    
    Get all element by class name:
      cy.get(".btn-with-class");

    Get all element with specific classes (or specific attribut)
      cy.get("[class='Elements-btn btn-with-class more-btn-classes']");
    
    Get all element by id
      cy.get("#btn-with-id");
      // or
      cy.get("[id='btn-with-id']");

    Get all elements by specific attribute
      cy.get("[type='submit']");

    Combine selector (get all element by tagname and class and id)
        cy.get("button.Elements-btn#btn-with-id");

  Best practice for selecting element:
    Instead of query element by id class or attribut, the best
    thing to do is query by test id, beacause this id not gonna change during the process

  Get element by data test id:
	cy.get("[data-cy='btn-id-1']")

  Create commands:
    Commands are an easy way to create reusable function cypress function to performe
    action like selecting particular element
  
    Create getByTestId command:
      Inside commands.js add : 
        Cypress.Commands.add("getByTestId", (testId) => {
            cy.get(`[data-cy='${testId}']`);
        });
	  This way this command can by use anywhere in our project

  Contains:
    contains get a DOM element that contains a specific text

    Get element by text:
      cy.contains("Unique Text");

    Get element with a not unique text => select the first element in the dom
    that contains this text:
      cy.contains("Not Unique Text");

    With selector:
      cy.contains("[type='submit']", "Not Unique Text");
      cy.contains("form", "Not Unique Text");

    Combine get and contains:
      cy.get("[type='submit']").contains("Not Unique Text");

  Find:
    find gonna find a chilld node element (rarely use)
    cy.get("#form-1").find(".btn-1");


  Interact with elements:
    Click:
      cy.contains("button", "Add").click();


  Asynchronous pages: 
    cypress by default work asynchronously, so there is nothing special to do
    while working with Asynchronous pages, cypress simply gonna wait for the pages

  Negation in assertion:
    all the assertion, have his negation, this can be done by the not. prefixe
      should("be.visible") = negation > should("not.be.visible")
