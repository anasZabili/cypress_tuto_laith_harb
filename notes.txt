Install Cypress:
  npm install Cypress

Run Cypress:
  npx cypress open

Select the right page to test:
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.visit("/element");
  });
  here before each test we set the current tested page
  at /element (the root of this url is the based root set
  in the cypress.json)


Select element :
  GET:
    Get by Tag:
      cy.get("button"), get all the button of the page
    
    Get all element by class name:
      cy.get(".btn-with-class");

    Get all element with specific classes (or specific attribut)
      cy.get("[class='Elements-btn btn-with-class more-btn-classes']");
    
    Get all element by id
      cy.get("#btn-with-id");
      // or
      cy.get("[id='btn-with-id']");

    Get all elements by specific attribute
      cy.get("[type='submit']");

    Combine selector (get all element by tagname and class and id)
        cy.get("button.Elements-btn#btn-with-id");

  Best practice for selecting element:
    Instead of query element by id class or attribut, the best
    thing to do is query by test id, beacause this id not gonna change during the process

  Get element by data test id:
	cy.get("[data-cy='btn-id-1']")
